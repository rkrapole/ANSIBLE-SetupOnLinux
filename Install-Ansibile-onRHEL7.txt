## ansible 2.10.3 installation

----->to have root previlleges
sudo su

----->to force your machine to update itself
yum update -y

----->install python & pip(pip comes by default with python)
yum install python3 -y
python3 --version(to use python alone set "alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3")

----->create ansible user
useradd ansadmin (to create user)
passwd ansadmin (to setup the password)
user: ansadmin
password: rapole@1105

----->add above user to sudors file
visudo (shift g+o, add above user and same previlleges as rootUser and save :wq)

----->enable password based authentication
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config (search for /password, change 'PasswordAuthentication' to Yes and save :wq)

----->reload sshd
systemctl reload sshd.service

-----> in RHEL7 we cannot install Ansible with root user, so switch to ansible user created above
su - ansadmin

----->install ansible
pip3 install ansible --user
ansible --version

-----> need hosts file to execute playbooks, so create /etc/ansible directory & hosts file
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
cd /etc/ansible/
sudo vi hosts (add client system ip's)

----->create ssh keys to enable passwordless authentication, between ur ansible control system to managed hosts
ssh-keygen
	[ansadmin@ip-172-31-81-182 ansible]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ansadmin/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/ansadmin/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/ansadmin/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/ansadmin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:i6moYrOkyZAE8XY3roWLXzXXYWmT5hnBKh8Mjgy5W10 ansadmin@ip-172-31-81-182.ec2.internal
The key's randomart image is:

-----> copy keys into target/local systems (this can be done by copying id_rsa.pub content to authorized_keys )
ssh-copy-id localhost (first time enter the password)

-----> test connections
ansible all -m ping
